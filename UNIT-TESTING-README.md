# Why Unit Test?

Testing isn't just a suggestion, it's a crucial skill for any developer. It helps you:

Catch bugs early: Identify and fix problems before they reach users.
Prevent regressions: Ensure changes don't break existing functionality.
Build confidence: Gain trust in your code's quality and stability.

It ensures you are building the thing, right.
